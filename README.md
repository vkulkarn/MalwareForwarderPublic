# MalwareForwarder

MalwareForwarder is an Outlook VSTO add-in that makes it easy for users to forward messages to a predefined address with just a single click.

The add-in adds two buttons to the Outlook Ribbon, one to forward Malware, one to forward Spam. You can set a separate forwarding address for each button, or disable either button. By default, the add-in will delete the original message and it will not save a copy of the sent email in the Sent Items folder. You can change either of these settings.

**Note** - *I haven't been a developer in a very long time, and this is my first attempt at writing anything in C# or writing an Office add-in. Keep that in mind when you use this code.*
